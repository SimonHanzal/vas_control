Subjective mental state and Fatigue, an Investigation into possible
paradoxical effects
================

Investigation of the questions as set out in the
[pre-registration](https://osf.io/fybc9).

# VAS difference confirmation

## Self-aware excluded

n = 12.

Phrases leading to exclusion:

- 20007: The participant become more fatigue significantly because of
  their performance expectations
- 20002: I thought the experiment was possibly about the placeblo effect
  and fatigue. I had it in my mind that the experimenter was looking to
  see if me participating in an experiment on neurofeedback
  interventions for fatigue would reduce the levels of fatigue that I
  felt

Are the two experiments different?
